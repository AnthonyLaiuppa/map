MapSnatch
======

A simple CLI tool meant to generate a mapping of a domain consisting of all of its subdomains as well as URL paths present on its top level domain. The tool will also attempt a GET request to assess which (sub)domains are reachable.

**Usage:** map --domain=example.com

**Installaion:**

>pip install -e .

>sublist3r and a dir containing subbrute need to be within this directory

This tool isnt a finished product by any means, Ill hopefully get around to adding some more additions to make it a better tool.
